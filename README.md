# Mission-to-Mars

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to add the four hemispheres of Mars as well as the titles, to store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

## Resources
Software: VSCode, Anaconda3, Jupyter Notebook

## Results
We ended up doing what was asked and then implementing some Bootstrap components like adding a background image to our "Jumbotron" header, as well as organizing the layout of our data and making the hemisphere thumbnails circles.
